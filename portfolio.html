                        <p>When I took over this program in March 2024, the team was struggling with scheduling conflicts, customer communication gaps, and weather-related delays that were impacting customer satisfaction. Through systematic process improvements and proactive risk management, I transformed this into a high-performing program delivering consistent results across 250+ installations.</p>

                        <h4 class="case-section-title">Installation Process Overview</h4>
                        <p>I manage the solar and battery programme through a structured four-phase approach, maintaining alignment between engineers, customers and grid operators from initial project handover through to export tariff activation. This disciplined methodology ensures consistent delivery standards while adapting to each installation's unique requirements.</p>

                        <div class="process-step">
                            <h5>Step 1 – Getting Ready for Installation (≈ four weeks)</h5>
                            <p>As soon as sales hand me a customer I complete the compliance triage: confirming the HIES warranty registration, pulling the final sales agreement into HubSpot and submitting the relevant G98, G99 or G100 application to the Distribution Network Operator. While the DNO reviews the design I walk the customer through structural requirements, arrange OpenSolar calculations for trussed roofs and book onsite calculations for cut roofs. Tesla Powerwall customers receive an earthing rod briefing, Octopus Energy customers get a smart meter upgrade if they still have a legacy meter, and I capture photos and access notes so our scaffolding partners can quote without a site visit. Weekly check-ins and CRM tasking keep every readiness action visible to the customer and the wider LCT team.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="process-step">
                            <h5>Step 2 – Scheduling and Locking In Logistics</h5>
                            <p>Once the DNO approval lands (or is safely pending three months ahead of install) I can book the job in Kraken Field. I double-check structural calculations, earth rod status and battery locations, then raise scaffolding requests with the appropriate regional supplier so the build is up at least three days before the crew arrives. I liaise with design to ensure the material picklist is uploaded in good time, brief the warehouse on any bespoke parts, and update installation notes so the field lead knows exactly what to expect. Customers also receive an export-tariff teach-in covering Outgoing Octopus, Flux and Intelligent Flux so they understand the four-to-six-week onboarding window.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="process-step">
                            <h5>Step 3 – Supporting the Installation</h5>
                            <p>The week of delivery starts with a call to the scaffolding partner and the customer to confirm safe access. During the install I remain the single point of contact: arranging waste collections where required, relaying daily progress from the installers, and escalating through Area Managers if weather or design snags threaten the schedule. For cut roofs I chase the structural report the same day it is uploaded so the customer's handover pack is complete.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="process-step">
                            <h5>Step 4 – Post-Installation Close-Out</h5>
                            <p>Within 24 hours of commissioning I carry out a courtesy call, confirm the G98/G99 paperwork has been submitted to the DNO and trigger the MCS certificate. I finalise HIES, NAPIT and NICEIC registrations, assemble the handover pack (including PV array tests and warranty information) and send this off to the customer. Finally, I raise the invoice, chase payment if needed, arrange scaffolding dismantling, and monitor the export tariff onboarding until the customer is officially live.</p>

                        <p>Residential EV charging sounds simple: mount a unit and plug in, but every driveway has a different grid profile, grant eligibility and customer confidence level. I therefore run the initiative as a four-beat journey that blends technical due diligence with concierge-style communication.</p>

                        <div class="process-step">
                            <h5>Step 1 – Getting Ready for Installation</h5>
                            <p>I start by analysing the customer’s post-sale survey: meter cupboard photos, proposed cable route, parking arrangements and any existing solar or battery integrations. That informs my maximum-demand calculation and whether an ENA notification or approval is required before work begins. Where demand exceeds the current cut-out or the property shares a supply, I submit applications to the DNO and set expectations on typical response times. In parallel I verify the presence of a smart meter (booking an upgrade if they are with Octopus and still on a legacy meter), guide tenants through OZEV grant eligibility, and arrange permissions for rentals, listed buildings or conservation areas. Any groundworks or third-party electrical works are scoped, costed and tracked in HubSpot so nothing surprises the customer later on.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="process-step">
                            <h5>Step 2 – Scheduling and Engineer Briefing</h5>
                            <p>Once the property is technically ready, I either release a self-serve booking link or schedule the installation manually through Kraken Field. Every booking is accompanied by detailed engineer notes that cover grant status, cable routing decisions, meter location constraints, complaint history and my direct contact details. I also reconfirm that any prerequisite DNO works or customer groundworks are complete, share the Standard/Standard Plus/Enhanced duration guidance, and set reminders to chase customers for photo evidence of completed readiness tasks.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="process-step">
                            <h5>Step 3 – Supporting the Installation Day</h5>
                            <p>During the install window I monitor the job card in Kraken Field and stay on-call for both the lead electrician and the homeowner. If anything stalls, perhaps a fuse upgrade has not been completed or an unexpected cable route is required, I coordinate with Area Managers or the compliance team to unblock it and keep the customer informed. Should an installation slip into “in progress” for more than a day, I call the customer first, document the root cause and set an immediate recovery plan.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="process-step">

                            <p>After commissioning I file the OZEV or WCS grant evidence, trigger the Intelligent Octopus Go onboarding journey and send charger-specific setup resources (Ohme, Zappi or Hypervolt). A follow-up call confirms the charger is performing, the app is connected and the customer understands smart tariff behaviours. Only when the tariff switch is confirmed and any snag list is closed do I mark the job complete.</p>

                        <h4 class="case-section-title">Installation Process Overview</h4>
                        <p>Heat pumps ask far more of a home than a like-for-like boiler swap, so I steward every project through a detailed readiness, delivery and aftercare cycle. The blueprint below translates the OES Low Carbon Tech handbook into a customer-facing journey.</p>

                        <div class="process-step">
                            <h5>Step 1 – Preparing the Property (30–75 days depending on planning)</h5>
                            <p>The moment a ticket lands I run compliance checks—confirming the HIES policy, logging the sale in HubSpot and submitting an ENA application so the DNO can confirm the supply can take the additional electrical load. I book an introductory call within 24 hours to map the property, discuss the proposed indoor and outdoor locations and agree the cadence of updates. From there I orchestrate the major readiness activities: engaging the planning team for conservation or listed properties, ordering asbestos sampling and removal through Crucial Environmental, arranging structural surveys where loft cylinders or new plant rooms are required, and scoping any repipe or radiator upgrades. Customers receive bespoke checklists, and I maintain weekly updates so they never feel adrift during the long-lead tasks.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="process-step">
                            <h5>Step 2 – Scheduling and Logistics</h5>
                            <p>When every blocker is cleared, I secure the installation slot in Kraken Field, making sure it respects the install length derived from our heat-loss calculations. I raise the Boiler Upgrade Scheme voucher, capture the EPC reference, and decide whether the customer needs gas capping, meter removal or a smart meter appointment. Scaffolding and lifting equipment are booked for homes that require high-level pipework, and I brief the warehouse on any bespoke components (for example buffer tanks or solar diverters). The Kraken Field job notes capture radiator counts, product families (Cosy or Daikin), access complexities and my direct contact details so the lead engineer, plumbers and electricians have a shared source of truth.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="process-step">
                            <h5>Step 3 – Coordinating the Install Week</h5>
                            <p>Installation weeks span multiple trades, so I check in on day one to confirm the crew has arrived, the old system is draining down safely and the schedule is holding. I coordinate Clearabee waste collections, monitor gas metering appointments, and resolve snags—be that a weather delay for the external unit or a late delivery of bespoke materials—by looping in Area Managers or logistics. Daily notes go back into HubSpot and Slack to keep customer, field and office teams perfectly aligned.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="process-step">
                            <h5>Step 4 – Commissioning, Grants and Handover</h5>
                            <p>Within 24 hours of commissioning I place a courtesy call, redeem the BUS voucher, and ensure the MCS certificate, HIES completion and NAPIT notification are filed. I register Daikin systems on Standby Me, assemble the digital handover pack (including heat-loss reports, warranties and user guides) and request scaffold strike. Payment, snag tracking and the first-service reminder are all scheduled before I mark the customer live and transition them to aftercare.</p>
